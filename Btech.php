<p>The Programs of study emphasize strong conceptual understanding and practical skills in their respective areas of specialization. All students are provided with a sound foundation in basic sciences, coupled with courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences in addition to courses of parent discipline.

The education system lays great emphasis on continuous evaluation and transparency by means of well designed tutorials and practicals. Every effort is made to reinforce the concepts taught in the classroom and further enhancement of the learning is made possible by a unique educational concept called Project-Oriented Practice (POP) which consists of a minor project given to students from 2nd to 6th semesters. In the final year, a major project is assigned to students.

Industry internship after the 6th Semester is an integral part of the academic Program leading to overall development of the student through exposure to practical skills in real life situations.

Education Methodology comprises multiple learning stages, specific Lectures, Self-study, Tutorials, Laboratory Work, Assignments, Projects, Research, Internships, Guest and Expert Lectures, Seminars, Continuous Evaluation, Examinations and Personality Development Programs.</p>
